# Programming in Python

The entry level course 'Programming in Python', by the [Utrecht Centre for Digital Humanities](https://cdh.uu.nl/) aims to teach the basics of the Python programming language. Special attention is given to best practices in coding, e.g.: writing clean code and documentation.

The course was first taught 15-16 November, 2021.

This repository contains all teaching materials, exercises, solutions and extra resources relevant to the course. All files are provided as IPython Notebooks.

## Running locally

It is also possible to run this course locally. This is possible by installing the following:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

Steps:

1. Install Python, Git and Visual Studio Code
2. Open Visual Studio Code
3. Choose "Clone Git Repository..."
4. Use the URL of this repository (https://github.com/UUDigitalHumanitieslab/programming-in-python.git)
5. Open a lesson using the file explorer on the left
6. Visual Studio Code will ask for installing various extensions to get it to work
7. It should just work now

Consult the [official documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html#id4) if you want to deviate from this or need more information.
