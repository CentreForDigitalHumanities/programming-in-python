    "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They’re quitee touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They’re nice and all - I’m not saying that - but they’re also touchy as hell. Besides, I’m not going to tell you my whole goodam autobiography or anything. I’ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out and take it easy. I mean that’s all I told D.B. about, and he’s my brother and all. He’s in Hollywood. That isn’t too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. He’s going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He’s got a lot of dough, now. He didn’t use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote thizs terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was «‘The Secret Goldfish.’ It was about this little kid that wouldn’t let anybody look at his goldfish because he’d bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he’s out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there’s one thing I hate, it’s the movies. Don’t even mention them to me.\n",
    "Where I want to start is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is the school that’s in Agertown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You’ve probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hot-shot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse’s picture, it always says: ‘Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men’. Strictly for the birds. They don’t do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn’t know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came to Pencey that way.\n",
    "Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide ou something if old Pencey didn’t win. I remember around three o’clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn’t see the granstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.\n",
    "There were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it. I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they’re only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something. Old Selma Thurmer - she was the headmaster’s master - showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn’t exactly the type that drove you mad with desire. She was a pretty nice girl, though, I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big nose and her nails were all all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. Wha I liked about her, she didn’t give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was. She probably knew what a phony slob h e was.\n",
    "The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I’d just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We’d gone in to Newyork that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn’t have the meet. I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn’t all my fault. I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we’d know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way.\n",
    "The other reason I wasn’t down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn’t see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn’t coming back to Pencey.\n",
    "I forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn’t supposed to come back after Christmas vacation, on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself - especially around mid-terms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer - but I didn’t do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.\n",
    "Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch’s teat, especially on top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. sThe week before that, somebody’d stolen my camel’s-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks. Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has - I’m not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn’t watching the game too much. What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by. I mean I’ve left schools and places I didn’t even know I was leaving them. I don’t care if it’s a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I live I like to know I’m leaving it. If you don’t, you feel even worse.\n",
    "I was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building. there were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway. It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball anyway. It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn’t want to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we had to. This teacher that taught biology, Mr Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one - at least, most of the time I can. As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer’s house. He didn’t live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.\n",
    "I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath. I have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I’m quite a heavy smoker, for one thing - that is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year. That’s also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff. I’m pretty healthy, though.\n",
    "Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran accross Route 204. It was icy as hell and I damn near fell down. I don’t know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it. After I got accross the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing. It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terricfically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.\n",
    "Boy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer’s house. I was really frozen. My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all. ‘C’mon, c’mon,’ I said right out loud, almost, ‘somebody open the door.’ Finally old Mrs Spencer opened it. They didn’t have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves. They didn’t have too much dough.\n",
    "‘Holden!’ Mrs Spencer said. ‘How lovely to see you! Come in, dear! Are youfrozen to death?’ I think she was glad to see me. She liked me. At least, I think she did.\n",
    "Boy, did I get in that house fast. ‘How are you, Mrs Spencer?’ I said. ‘How’s Mr Spencer?’\n",
    "‘Let me take your coat, dear,’ she said. She didn’t hear me ask her how Mr Spencer was. She was sort of deaf.\n",
    "She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand. I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much. ‘How’ve you been, Mrs Spencer?’ I said again, only louder, so she’d hear me.\n",
    "‘I’ve been just fine, Holden.’ She closed the closet door. ‘How have you been?’ The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer’d told her I’d been kicked out.\n",
    "‘Fine,’ I said. ‘How’s Mr Spencer? He over his grippe yet?’\n",
    "‘Over it! Holden, he’s behaving like a perfect - I don’t know what... He’s in his room, dear. Go right in.’\n",

    "Matilda's brother Michael was a perfectly normal boy, but\n",
    "the sister, as I said, was something to make your eyes pop. By\n",
    "the age of one and a half her speech was perfect and she\n",
    "knew as many words as most grown-ups. The parents, instead \n",
    "of applauding her, called her a noisy chatterbox and told her\n",
    "sharply that small girls should be seen and not heard.\n",
    "By the time she was three, Matilda had taught herself to\n",

    "lovely telly with a twelve-inch screen and now you come\n",
    "asking for a book! You're getting spoiled, my girl!\"\n",
    "Nearly every weekday afternoon Matilda was left alone in\n",
    "the house. Her brother (five years older than her) went to\n",
    "school. Her father went to work and her mother went out\n",
    "playing bingo in a town eight miles away. Mrs Wormwood\n",
    "was hooked on bingo and played it five afternoons a week. On \n",
    "the afternoon of the day when her father had refused to buy\n",
    "her a book, Matilda set out all by herself to walk to the public\n",
    "library in the village. When she arrived, she introduced\n",
    "herself to the librarian, Mrs Phelps. She asked if she might sit\n",
    "awhile and read a book. Mrs Phelps, slightly taken aback at\n",
    "the arrival of such a tiny girl unacccompanied by a parent,\n",
    "nevertheless told her she was very welcome.\n",
    "\"Where are the children's books please?\" Matilda asked.\n",

    "told her. \"Would you like me to help you find a nice one with\n",
    "lots of pictures in it?\"\n",

    "From then on, every afternoon, as soon as her mother had\n",
    "left for bingo, Matilda would toddle down to the library. The\n",
    "walk took only ten minutes and this allowed her two glorious\n",
    "hours sitting quietly by herself in a cosy corner devouring one\n",
    "book after another. When she had read every single children's\n",
    "book in the place, she started wandering round in search of\n",
    "something else.\n",
    "Mrs Phelps, who had been watching her with fascination\n",
    "for the past few weeks, now got up from her desk and went\n",
    "over to her. \"Can I help you, Matilda?\" she asked. \n",
    "\"I'm wondering what to read next,\" Matilda said. \"I've\n",
    "finished all the children's books.\"\n",
    "\"You mean you've looked at the pictures?\"\n",
    "\"Yes, but I've read the books as well.\"\n",
    "Mrs Phelps looked down at Matilda from her great height\n",
    "and Matilda looked right back up at her.\n",
    "\"I thought some were very poor,\" Matilda said, \"but others\n",
    "were lovely. I liked The Secret Garden best of all. It was full of\n",
    "mystery. The mystery of the room behind the closed door and\n",
    "the mystery of the garden behind the big wall.\"\n",
    "Mrs Phelps was stunned. ''Exactly how old are you,\n",
    "Matilda?\" she asked.\n",
    "\"Four years and three months,\" Matilda said.\n",
    "Mrs Phelps was more stunned than ever, but she had the\n",
    "sense not to show it. \"What sort of a book would you like to\n",
    "read next?\" she asked.\n",
    "Matilda said, \"I would like a really good one that grownups read. A famous one. I don't know any names.\"\n",
    "Mrs Phelps looked along the shelves, taking her time. She\n",
    "didn't quite know what to bring out. How, she asked herself,\n",
    "does one choose a famous grown-up book for a four-year-old\n",
    "girl? Her first thought was to pick a young teenager's\n",
    "romance of the kind that is written for fifteen-year-old \n",
    "schoolgirls, but for some reason she found herself instinctively walking past that particular shelf.\n",
    "\"Try this,\" she said at last. \"It's very famous and very good.\n",
    "If it's too long for you, just let me know and I'll find\n",
    "something shorter and a bit easier.\"\n",
    "\"Great Expectations,\" Matilda read, \"by Charles Dickens.\n",
    "I'd love to try it.\"\n",
    "I must be mad, Mrs Phelps told herself, but to Matilda she\n",
    "said, \"Of course you may try it.\"\n",
    "Over the next few afternoons Mrs Phelps could hardly take\n",
    "her eyes from the small girl sitting for hour after hour in the\n",
    "big armchair at the far end of the room with the book on her\n",
    "lap. It was necessary to rest it on the lap because it was too\n",
    "heavy for her to hold up, which meant she had to sit leaning\n",
    "forward in order to read. And a strange sight it was, this tiny\n",
    "dark-haired person sitting there with her feet nowhere near\n",
    "touching the floor, totally absorbed in the wonderful\n",
    "adventures of Pip and old Miss Havisham and her cobwebbed\n",
    "house and by the spell of magic that Dickens the great storyteller had woven with his words. The only movement from\n",
    "the reader was the lifting of the hand every now and then to\n",
    "turn over a page, and Mrs Phelps always felt sad when the \n",
    "time came for her to cross the floor and say; \"It's ten to five,\n",
    "Matilda.\"\n",
    "During the first week of Matilda's visits Mrs Phelps had\n",
    "said to her, \"Does your mother walk you down here every day\n",
    "and then take you home?\"\n",
    "\"My mother goes to Aylesbury every afternoon to play\n",
    "bingo,\" Matilda had said. \"She doesn't know I come here.\"\n",
    "\"But that's surely not right,\" Mrs Phelps said. \"I think you'd\n",
    "better ask her.\"\n",
    "\"I'd rather not,\" Matilda said. \"She doesn't encourage\n",
    "reading books. Nor does my father.\"\n",
    "\"But what do they expect you to do every afternoon in an\n",
    "empty house?\"\n",
    "\"Just mooch around and watch the telly.\"\n",
    "\"I see.\"\n",

    "sadly.\n",
    "Mrs Phelps was concerned about the child's safety on the\n",
    "walk through the fairly busy village High Street and the\n",
    "crossing of the road, but she decided not to interfere.\n",
    "Within a week, Matilda had finished Great Expectations\n",
    "which in that edition contained four hundred and eleven \n",
    "pages. \"I loved it,\" she said to Mrs Phelps. \"Has Mr Dickens\n",
    "written any others?\"\n",
    "\"A great number,\" said the astounded Mrs Phelps. \"Shall I\n",
    "choose you another?\"\n",

    "It was a formidable list and by now Mrs Phelps was filled\n",
    "with wonder and excitement, but it was probably a good thing\n",
    "that she did not allow herself to be completely carried away\n",
    "by it all. Almost anyone else witnessing the achievements of\n",
    "this small child would have been tempted to make a great fuss\n",
    "and shout the news all over the village and beyond, but not so\n",
    "Mrs Phelps. She was someone who minded her own business\n",
    "and had long since discovered it was seldom worth while to\n",
    "interfere with other people's children.\n",
    "\"Mr Hemingway says a lot of things I don't understand,\"\n",
    "Matilda said to her. \"Especially about men and women. But I\n",
    "loved it all the same. The way he tells it I feel I am right there\n",
    "on the spot watching it all happen.\"\n",
    "''A fine writer will always make you feel that,\" Mrs Phelps\n",
    "said. \"And don't worry about the bits you can't understand.\n",
    "Sit back and allow the words to wash around you, like music.\"\n",
    "\"I will, I will.\"\n",
    "\"Did you know\", Mrs Phelps said, \"that public libraries like\n",
    "this allow you to borrow books and take them home?\"\n",
    "\"I didn't know that,\" Matilda said. \"Could I do it?\"\n",
    "\"Of course,\" Mrs Phelps said. \"When you have chosen the\n",

    "Her own small bedroom now became her reading-room and\n",

    "above a fresh-poured seltzer. The coach, in a slight accent neither British nor Australian, is telling C.T. that the whole applicationinterface process, while usually just a pleasant formality, is probably best accentuated by letting the applicant speak up for\n",
    "himself. Right and center Deans have inclined together in soft conference, forming a kind of tepee of skin and hair. I presume it's\n",
    "probably facilitate that the tennis coach mistook for accentuate, though accelerate, while clunkier than facilitate, is from a phonetic\n",
    "perspective more sensible, as a mistake. The Dean with the flat yellow face has leaned forward, his lips drawn back from his teeth\n",

    "serious and sotto, still looking at the file before him as if it were a plate of something bad, Til tell you right now my opinion is it\n",
    "wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be fair to the other applicants. Wouldn't be fair to the University community.' He looks at me. 'And\n",
    "it'd be especially unfair to Hal himself. Admitting a boy we see as simply an athletic asset would amount to just using that boy.\n",

    "using you.’\n",
    "Uncle Charles is asking Coach White to ask the Dean of Athletic Affairs whether the weather over scores would be as heavy\n",

    "something he said was really unpleasant-looking in my upturned palm. He says I was around five and crying and was vividly red\n",
    "in the cold spring air. I was saying something over and over; he couldn't make it out until our mother saw me and shut down the\n",

    "from some dark corner of the Weston home's basement, which was warm from the furnace and flooded every spring. The patch\n",
    "itself he describes as horrific: darkly green, glossy, vaguely hirsute, speckled with parasitic fungal points of yellow, orange, red.\n",
    "Worse, they could see that the patch looked oddly incomplete, gnawed-on; and some of the nauseous stuff was smeared around\n",
    "my open mouth. 'I ate this,' was what I was saying. I held the patch out to the Moms, who had her contacts out for the dirty work,\n",

    "O. says he can only remember (sic) saying something caustic as he lim-boed a crick out of his back. He says he must have felt\n",
    "a terrible impending anxiety. The Moms refused ever even to go into the damp basement. I had stopped crying, he remembers, and\n",
    "simply stood there, the size and shape of a hydrant, in red PJ's with attached feet, holding out the mold, seriously, like the report of\n",
    "some kind of audit.\n",
    "O. says his memory diverges at this point, probably as a result of anxiety. In his first memory, the Moms's path around the\n",
