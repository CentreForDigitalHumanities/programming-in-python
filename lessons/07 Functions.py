#
# ### This module
#
# - Storing code in a variable so you can reuse it.
# - Being explicit about the purpose of your code.

# %% [markdown] id="mnc8HshNPLte"
# ## (Re)Introducing functions
#
# A function is a reusable piece of code, stored in a variable. You *call* a function by passing it a list of *arguments* between parentheses. The function *returns* a value, which you can then use in an expression or store in another variable. We have already seen several functions:

# %% id="IP2mOWYgR-QA"
result = ord('ðŸŽµ')
print(type(result), result)

result = len([1, 2, 3])
print(type(result), result)

result = str(ord)
print(type(result), result)

# %% [markdown] id="u_YUDiccZKwh"
# The fact that functions are variables, is illustrated by the fact that you can store them in variables and even reassign them:

# %% id="Mct6Hy3HZa5H"
my_ord = ord
print(my_ord('a'))
ord = chr
print(ord(97))

# don't do this with 'list'!!!!!

# back to sanity!
ord = my_ord

# this can also restore sanity
# %reset_selective ord

# reset resets everything
# %reset

ord('a')

# %% [markdown] id="hBgqVL7sSyFx"
# The list of arguments may be empty. For example, if you pass no arguments to `list`, it returns an empty list:

# %% id="wb98z1kBS9tm"
result = list()
print(result)

# %% [markdown] id="Byutz190TEH-"
# You can also pass multiple arguments (depending on the function).

# %% id="N7YW9_X_UOuB"
result = max(3, 4, 5)
print(result)

# %% [markdown] id="H0SocqBbXQ6f"
# A *named argument* or *keyword argument*, prefixed with `name=`, makes the purpose of the argument explicit. Below, the argument with the name `end` has the value `' '`.

# %% id="uTk4InjdXg5g"
print('one', end=' ')
print('two')

# %% [markdown] id="dCUHGgepctcp"
# Arguments *without* a name are called *positional* arguments, because their roles are determined by the order in which they are supplied.
#
# In our example of `max(3, 4, 5)` above, `3`, `4`, and `5` are positional arguments. In this case, the order of the numbers does not actually matter (the maximum is the same, no matter what).
#
# However, for most functions, this is not the case! An example you have already seen is `range`: the first argument is the _start_ and the second argument is the _stop_.

# %% id="yCyPbsvAd5PB"
assert max(3, 4, 5) is max(4, 3, 5)

assert range(1, 5) is not range(5, 1)

# %% [markdown] id="ECGJttnRUX_J"
# A function may return "nothing", i.e., `None`.

# %% id="gAMO-QD4Uuxe"
result = print('hello')
print(result)

# %% [markdown] id="Bj4diwbcU1Q7"
# A function may even return multiple results, i.e., a tuple. We can *unpack* those directly into multiple variables, but we can also store the whole tuple in a single variable.

# %% id="yYRQIGnoVHWA"
my_tuple = tuple(['Jelte', 'Julian'])
result1, result2 = my_tuple
print(my_tuple)
print(result1)
print(result2)

# %% [markdown] id="xMHYhvPhVXet"
# Some functions have *side effects*: apart from taking arguments and returning results, they also have some other external effect.

# %% id="OKEha-rwVo99"
result1 = input('Please enter PIN: ') # returns input from user
result2 = print(result1) # returns nothing
print(result2)
print(result1)

# %% [markdown] id="emAs76qOagVF"
# ## Functions are awesome!
#
# The following code, which does *not* use enough functions, is **bad**:

# %% id="n0UOjklcbEHQ"
print('"banana" has 6 characters and starts with a lowercase')
print('"Ada" has 3 characters and starts with an uppercase')
print('"epigraph" has 8 characters and starts with a lowercase')

# %% [markdown] id="vAt_0PfecAGK"
# Problems:
#
# - repetitive
# - not explicit
# - unmaintainable
#
# To some extent, we can address these problems with a loop:

# %% id="MeUnr3KNcaVZ"
words = ['banana', 'Ada', 'epigraph']

for word in words:
    quoted = '"' + word + '"'
    length = len(word)
    first_character = word[0]
    if 'A' <= first_character <= 'Z':
        initial = 'an uppercase'
    else:
        initial = 'a lowercase'
    print(quoted, 'has', length, 'characters and starts with', initial)


# %% [markdown] id="FL0w8VMkeLm7"
# BUT
#
# - still not explicit
# - still repetitive, need to repeat the loop if I want to do this elsewhere

# %% [markdown] id="bBiz8La8jv81"
# Functions let us solve all problems!

# %% id="HOjpPJBNiSvr"

    print(describe(word))


# %% [markdown] id="y77LwKKjk-2D"
# ## Basic function definitions
#
# At a minimum, you need the keyword `def`, a name, a pair of parentheses, a colon, and an indented block. The indented block is called the *function body*. It can contain anything!

# %% id="Ph3RsaBbllvB"
# Defining the function with the name "example"
def example():
    pass # ah, that placeholder again

# Calling the function with the name "example"
result = example()
print(result)


# %% [markdown] id="6Esxqtn0y1Ai"
# Keep in mind that a function *definition* only stores the code of the function body inside a variable with the name of the function. The code **does not run** until you *call* the function.

# %% id="vBfiX0-WzWQg"
def example():
    # Don't call print inside a function!
    # We only do this here for demonstration purposes.
    print('Hello, world!')

print(type(example), example)


# %% [markdown] id="S3cY2mRgl9z8"
# Between the parentheses, we list the *parameters*, the "slots" that can be filled by passing arguments when calling the function.
#
# The parameters (and any new variables that you make within the function body) have limited _scope_: they only live within the body of the function.

# %% id="fWAzMGqfnC8p"
def example(name, age):
    print(name)
    print(age)

name = 'Sheean'
age = 36

print(name)
print(age)

result = example('Julian', 35)
print(result)

print(name)
print(age)


# %% [markdown] id="J5Pd_TjZqnwj"
# At the end of the function body, a function will implicitly return `None`. The `return` keyword lets you return a different value, return before the end of the body, or both. You can use the keyword multiple times, but **a function can return only once**, so an early return will skip the remainder of the function body.

# %% id="48ARWWmvrgjz"

# %% [markdown] id="kOlF8tonzwZr"
# Functions should **not** have side effects unless that is the very purpose of the function (like with `print` and `input`). Most functions should return a value rather than printing something to the screen!

# %% [markdown] id="spLYBkqtvDmF"
# It is a good habit to start a function with a *documentation string*, **docstring** for short. A docstring should explain the parameters and possible return values of the function, as well as any rules or side effects that apply.
#
# A docstring should start with a short description of the function that fits on a single line. If there is more to explain, add the rest after a blank line.
#

# %% [markdown] id="nM43w3VlB3-O"
# 1. Write a function `last_a_index` that, given a string, returns the **last** index of the letter `'a'` in the string. If there is no `'a'` in the string, the function should return `None`.

# 2. Write a function `replace` with three string arguments: `text`, `query` and `replacement`. It should return a copy of `text` in which all occurrences of `query` are replaced by `replacement`. For example, `replace('small', 'a', 'e')` should return `'smell'`. You may assume that `query` is always a single character. For an additional challenge, you can try to also handle multi-character query strings. For ultimate challenge, try to think of a way to handle the empty string!

# 2. Using your functions `fizz` and `buzz` from step 1, write the function `fizzbuzz(number)`, which implements the well-known rules from before, but with a slight **twist**:
#     - If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, return `'FizzBuzz'`.
#     - If the number is divisible by 3 but not by 5, return `'Fizz'`.
#     - If the number is divisible by 5 but not by 3, return `'Buzz'`.
#     - In all other cases, return the number itself **as a string**.

# 3. Write a function `chunk10(sequence)` that takes an iterable `sequence` and returns a list of lists: the first sublist contains the first ten elements of `sequence`, the second sublist contains the next ten elements of `sequence`, and so on. You may assume that the number of values in `sequence` is an exact multiple of 10.

assert chunk10('Sheean!!!!!') == [list('Sheean!!!!!')]
assert chunk10('Hey Julian, let us have lunch!') == [
    list('Hey Julian'),
    list(', let us h'),
    list('ave lunch!'),
]
assert chunk10(range(20)) == [list(range(10)), list(range(10, 20))]

# 4. In step 1, you may have written definitions for `fizz` and `buzz` that look very similar to each other. Can you think of a way to avoid repeating the common elements?

# 5. In exercise 7.1.3, you documented the function `join_commas`. We did not actually need to write that function, because it is built into Python, although it goes by the name `', '.join`. That notation also works with other strings, as we demonstrate below. We also remind you of `map`, which appeared in the lecture.<br><br>
# Using these functions, as well as your own `fizzbuzz` from step 2 and your own `chunk10` from step 3, try to recreate (roughly) the same `FizzBuzz` output for the numbers 1 through 100 as in [exercise 6.2.4](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AZY4ESmsKKMvbalBDLlMrezAM5NzXXxV#scrollTo=uyqbuhKsUlhG), in as little code as you can.

# The following code is just for illustration.
# You do not need it in your solution.
fruits = ['apricot', 'banana', 'cherry']
print(', '.join(fruits))
print('\n'.join(fruits))
numbers = list(range(10))
print(numbers)
strings = map(str, numbers)
print(list(strings))
