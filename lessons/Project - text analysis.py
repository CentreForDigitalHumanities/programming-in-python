# # Project - Text Analysis
# In this series of exercises you will develop a text analysis tool. The steps roughly simulate real-life Digital Humanities projects:
# - Obtaining data
# - Cleaning data
# - Running analyses
#
#

# %% [markdown] id="OSpUjXmAqJI9"
# > üí° The exercises are very useful and fun if you would like to analyse textual data. The code you write here can be reused in your own analysis.
#
# > ‚ö†Ô∏è The exercises are difficult and may take you some time to complete. Consider them a bonus, study them at home, and don't be hestitant to contact the instructors, during or after the course. If you are not interested in text-analysis, ask the instructors for similarly challenging projects on a different topic, or pursue your own ideas!

# Add an optional parameter named `only_periods` to `clean_interpunction`.

# ### The data
# In the `class materials` section of the [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aAlr7pcE2v9p1eaKT1BtNxJAB9mgCFT1olZvAMswJlEc1%40thread.tacv2/Algemeen?groupId=7fd15384-6748-4852-8646-d96963fb3524&tenantId=d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7) you will find three `.txt`files:
#
#
# - `catcher_chapter1.txt`, containing the first chapter of The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
# - `matilda_chapter1.txt`, containing the first chapter of Matilda by Roald Dahl
# - `ij_chapter1.txt`, containing a part of the first chapter (the chapters are way too long) of Inifite Jest by David Foster Wallace.
#
# Write some code that loads the whole content of each of these files into its corresponding variable, see code cell below.
#
# We will use these variables in the rest of the notebook. Make sure you've executed this cell at least once.
#

# %% id="q_58MJYQadJO"

# %% [markdown] id="EuaRmuhwhTIZ"
# ### Writing functions
# Implement a few function to use in the final analysis:
#
# 1. Implement a function that counts the total number of words given a string containing a full text.
# 2. Implement a function that calculates the average sentence length of a text. The sentence length is defined as the number of words in a sentence. Use your implementation of `split_sentences`.<sup>1</sup>
# 3. Implement a function that calculates the average word length of a text. Again, use your implementation of `split sentences`.<sup>1</sup>
# 4. Bonus: implement a function that calculates the [automated readability index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index) of a text.
#
# <sup>1</sup> *You can and may combine 2. and 3. into a single function that returns two values.*
#
#
#
#

# %% [markdown] id="SSnrAH0xjUx8"
# ### Output
# Implement a function that calls 1-3 (and optionally 4) for each of the novels, and outputs their results. Try to format it in a nice way, so that it is clear what the output is.
