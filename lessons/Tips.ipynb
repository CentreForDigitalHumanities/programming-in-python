However, since you may encounter the terminology and the notation when using third-party packages, here is a *very* quick explanation.\n","\n","An **object** is a value with internal structure. For example, I might have a variable with the name `jack` that holds a description of my friend Jack. The parts of that description are called its **attributes**. In this example, `jack.name` might hold the string `'Jack'` and `jack.phone` might hold the string `'+31612345678'` (not his real phone number ;-). `jack` is the object and `name` and `phone` are its attributes.\n","\n","Attributes can hold all types of values, including functions. In the latter case, the attribute is also called a **method**. For example, `jack.call()` might dial Jack's number. Attributes might also themselves be objects with their own nested attributes, so you can have chains of names connected with dots, for example `house.kitchen.sink`. In the latter dotted name, `kitchen` and `sink` are both attributes, and `house` and `kitchen` must both be objects, though `sink` might be an object as well.\n","\n","Whenever you see two names connected with a dot, the left one must be an object. You have already encountered a few types of objects. Every list has an `.append()` method, so lists are objects. When you call `csv.reader()`, the `csv` module is an object (though we usually don't use the words \"attribute\" and \"method\" to refer to the parts of a module; we rather say that `csv.reader` is a *qualified name*). In fact, *nearly everything* in Python is an object; this is why it is called an *object-oriented* programming language.\n","\n","Objects are generally created using a **class**. You can think of a class as a template for creating objects of a particular shape. For example, our `jack` object might have been created using the `Person` class. We say that `jack` is an **instance** of `Person` and also that we **instantiated** `Person` when we created `jack`. Typically, you can expect all instances of a class to have the same attributes and methods. Packages often organize their documentation by class, listing the methods of its instances and their usage.\n","\n","Instantiating a class looks exactly like calling a function and storing the return value in a variable. The only visible clue that you're instantiating a class rather than calling a function, is that classes usually have a name starting with an uppercase letter:\n","\n","```py\n","jack = Person(name='Jack')\n","```\n","\n","There is no danger in thinking of a class instantiation as a function call, or in instantiating a class without knowing it because its name starts with a lowercase letter. In reality, however, a class is not a function but an object!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MoyqHwBhvBTH"},"source":["## Working with times and calendar dates\n","\n","The [`datetime`][datetime] standard module provides tools for working with dates and times.
