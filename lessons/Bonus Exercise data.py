If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They’re quitee touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They’re nice and all - I’m not saying that - but they’re also touchy as hell. Besides, I’m not going to tell you my whole goodam autobiography or anything. I’ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out and take it easy. I mean that’s all I told D.B. about, and he’s my brother and all. He’s in Hollywood. That isn’t too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. He’s going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He’s got a lot of dough, now. He didn’t use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote thizs terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was «‘The Secret Goldfish.’ It was about this little kid that wouldn’t let anybody look at his goldfish because he’d bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he’s out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there’s one thing I hate, it’s the movies. Don’t even mention them to me.
Where I want to start is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is the school that’s in Agertown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You’ve probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hot-shot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse’s picture, it always says: ‘Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men’. Strictly for the birds. They don’t do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn’t know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came to Pencey that way.
Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide ou something if old Pencey didn’t win. I remember around three o’clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn’t see the granstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.
There were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it. I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they’re only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something. Old Selma Thurmer - she was the headmaster’s master - showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn’t exactly the type that drove you mad with desire. She was a pretty nice girl, though, I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big nose and her nails were all all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. Wha I liked about her, she didn’t give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was. She probably knew what a phony slob h e was.
The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I’d just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We’d gone in to Newyork that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn’t have the meet. I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn’t all my fault. I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we’d know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way.
The other reason I wasn’t down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn’t see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn’t coming back to Pencey.
I forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn’t supposed to come back after Christmas vacation, on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself - especially around mid-terms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer - but I didn’t do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.
Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch’s teat, especially on top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. sThe week before that, somebody’d stolen my camel’s-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks. Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has - I’m not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn’t watching the game too much. What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by. I mean I’ve left schools and places I didn’t even know I was leaving them. I don’t care if it’s a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I live I like to know I’m leaving it. If you don’t, you feel even worse.
I was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building. there were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway. It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball anyway. It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn’t want to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we had to. This teacher that taught biology, Mr Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one - at least, most of the time I can. As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer’s house. He didn’t live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.
I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath. I have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I’m quite a heavy smoker, for one thing - that is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year. That’s also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff. I’m pretty healthy, though.
Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran accross Route 204. It was icy as hell and I damn near fell down. I don’t know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it. After I got accross the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing. It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terricfically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.
Boy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer’s house. I was really frozen. My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all. ‘C’mon, c’mon,’ I said right out loud, almost, ‘somebody open the door.’ Finally old Mrs Spencer opened it. They didn’t have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves. They didn’t have too much dough.
‘Holden!’ Mrs Spencer said. ‘How lovely to see you! Come in, dear! Are youfrozen to death?’ I think she was glad to see me. She liked me. At least, I think she did.
Boy, did I get in that house fast. ‘How are you, Mrs Spencer?’ I said. ‘How’s Mr Spencer?’
‘Let me take your coat, dear,’ she said. She didn’t hear me ask her how Mr Spencer was. She was sort of deaf.
She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand. I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much. ‘How’ve you been, Mrs Spencer?’ I said again, only louder, so she’d hear me.
‘I’ve been just fine, Holden.’ She closed the closet door. ‘How have you been?’ The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer’d told her I’d been kicked out.
‘Fine,’ I said. ‘How’s Mr Spencer? He over his grippe yet?’
‘Over it! Holden, he’s behaving like a perfect - I don’t know what... He’s in his room, dear. Go right in.’

matilda_chapter1 = '''It's a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their
own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever
imagine, they still think that he or she is wonderful.
Some parents go further. They become so blinded by
adoration they manage to convince themselves their child has
qualities of genius.
Well, there is nothing very wrong with all this. It's the way
of the world. It is only when the parents begin telling us about
the brilliance of their own revolting offspring, that we start
shouting, "Bring us a basin! We're going to be sick!"

School teachers suffer a good deal from having to listen to
this sort of twaddle from proud parents, but they usually get
their own back when the time comes to write the end-of-term
reports. If I were a teacher I would cook up some real
scorchers for the children of doting parents. "Your son
Maximilian", I would write, "is a total wash-out. I hope you
have a family business you can push him into when he leaves
school because he sure as heck won't get a job anywhere else."
Or if I were feeling lyrical that day, I might write, "It is a
curious truth that grasshoppers have their hearing-organs in 
the sides of the abdomen. Your daughter Vanessa, judging by
what she's learnt this term, has no hearing-organs at all."

I might even delve deeper into natural history and say,
"The periodical cicada spends six years as a grub
underground, and no more than six days as a free creature of
sunlight and air. Your son Wilfred has spent six years as a
grub in this school and we are still waiting for him to emerge
from the chrysalis." A particularly poisonous little girl might
sting me into saying, "Fiona has the same glacial beauty as an
iceberg, but unlike the iceberg she has absolutely nothing
below the surface." I
think I might enjoy writing end-of-term reports for the
stinkers in my class. But enough of that. We have to get on.
Occasionally one comes across parents who take the
opposite line, who show no interest at all in their children,
and these of course are far worse than the doting ones. Mr
and Mrs Wormwood were two such parents. They had a son
called Michael and a daughter called Matilda, and the parents
looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is something
you have to put up with until the time c
when you can pick it off and flick it away.
omes 
Mr and Mrs Wormwood looked forward enormously to the
time when they could pick their little daughter off and flick
her away, preferably into the next county or even further than
that.
It is bad enough when parents treat ordinary children as
though they were scabs and bunions, but it becomes
somehow a lot worse when the child in
question is extraordinary, and by that I
mean sensitive and brilliant. Matilda was
both of these things, but above all she was
brilliant. Her mind was so nimble and she
was so quick to learn that her ability should
have been obvious even to the most half-witted of parents.
But Mr and Mrs Wormwood were both so gormless and so
wrapped up in their own silly little lives that they failed to
notice anything unusual about their daughter. To tell the
truth, I doubt they would have noticed had she crawled into
the house with a broken leg.
Matilda's brother Michael was a perfectly normal boy, but
the sister, as I said, was something to make your eyes pop. By
the age of one and a half her speech was perfect and she
knew as many words as most grown-ups. The parents, instead 
of applauding her, called her a noisy chatterbox and told her
sharply that small girls should be seen and not heard.
By the time she was three, Matilda had taught herself to
read by studying newspapers and magazines that lay around
the house. At the age of four, she could read fast and well and
she naturally began hankering after books. The only book in
the whole of this enlightened household was something called
Easy Cooking belonging to her mother, and when she had
read this from cover to cover and had learnt all the recipes by
heart, she decided she wanted something more interesting.

"Daddy," she said, "do you think you could buy me a
book?"
"A book?" he said. "What d'you want a flaming book for?"
"To read, Daddy."
"What's wrong with the telly, for heaven's sake? We've got a
lovely telly with a twelve-inch screen and now you come
asking for a book! You're getting spoiled, my girl!"
Nearly every weekday afternoon Matilda was left alone in
the house. Her brother (five years older than her) went to
school. Her father went to work and her mother went out
playing bingo in a town eight miles away. Mrs Wormwood
was hooked on bingo and played it five afternoons a week. On 
the afternoon of the day when her father had refused to buy
her a book, Matilda set out all by herself to walk to the public
library in the village. When she arrived, she introduced
herself to the librarian, Mrs Phelps. She asked if she might sit
awhile and read a book. Mrs Phelps, slightly taken aback at
the arrival of such a tiny girl unacccompanied by a parent,
nevertheless told her she was very welcome.
"Where are the children's books please?" Matilda asked.
"They're over there on those lower shelves," Mrs Phelps
told her. "Would you like me to help you find a nice one with
lots of pictures in it?"
"No, thank you," Matilda said. "I'm sure I can manage."
From then on, every afternoon, as soon as her mother had
left for bingo, Matilda would toddle down to the library. The
walk took only ten minutes and this allowed her two glorious
hours sitting quietly by herself in a cosy corner devouring one
book after another. When she had read every single children's
book in the place, she started wandering round in search of
something else.
Mrs Phelps, who had been watching her with fascination
for the past few weeks, now got up from her desk and went
over to her. "Can I help you, Matilda?" she asked. 
"I'm wondering what to read next," Matilda said. "I've
finished all the children's books."
"You mean you've looked at the pictures?"
"Yes, but I've read the books as well."
Mrs Phelps looked down at Matilda from her great height
and Matilda looked right back up at her.
"I thought some were very poor," Matilda said, "but others
were lovely. I liked The Secret Garden best of all. It was full of
mystery. The mystery of the room behind the closed door and
the mystery of the garden behind the big wall."
Mrs Phelps was stunned. ''Exactly how old are you,
Matilda?" she asked.
"Four years and three months," Matilda said.
Mrs Phelps was more stunned than ever, but she had the
sense not to show it. "What sort of a book would you like to
read next?" she asked.
Matilda said, "I would like a really good one that grownups read. A famous one. I don't know any names."
Mrs Phelps looked along the shelves, taking her time. She
didn't quite know what to bring out. How, she asked herself,
does one choose a famous grown-up book for a four-year-old
girl? Her first thought was to pick a young teenager's
romance of the kind that is written for fifteen-year-old 
schoolgirls, but for some reason she found herself instinctively walking past that particular shelf.
"Try this," she said at last. "It's very famous and very good.
If it's too long for you, just let me know and I'll find
something shorter and a bit easier."
"Great Expectations," Matilda read, "by Charles Dickens.
I'd love to try it."
I must be mad, Mrs Phelps told herself, but to Matilda she
said, "Of course you may try it."
Over the next few afternoons Mrs Phelps could hardly take
her eyes from the small girl sitting for hour after hour in the
big armchair at the far end of the room with the book on her
lap. It was necessary to rest it on the lap because it was too
heavy for her to hold up, which meant she had to sit leaning
forward in order to read. And a strange sight it was, this tiny
dark-haired person sitting there with her feet nowhere near
touching the floor, totally absorbed in the wonderful
adventures of Pip and old Miss Havisham and her cobwebbed
house and by the spell of magic that Dickens the great storyteller had woven with his words. The only movement from
the reader was the lifting of the hand every now and then to
turn over a page, and Mrs Phelps always felt sad when the 
time came for her to cross the floor and say; "It's ten to five,
Matilda."
During the first week of Matilda's visits Mrs Phelps had
said to her, "Does your mother walk you down here every day
and then take you home?"
"My mother goes to Aylesbury every afternoon to play
bingo," Matilda had said. "She doesn't know I come here."
"But that's surely not right," Mrs Phelps said. "I think you'd
better ask her."
"I'd rather not," Matilda said. "She doesn't encourage
reading books. Nor does my father."
"But what do they expect you to do every afternoon in an
empty house?"
"Just mooch around and watch the telly."
"I see."
"She doesn't really care what I do," Matilda said a little
sadly.
Mrs Phelps was concerned about the child's safety on the
walk through the fairly busy village High Street and the
crossing of the road, but she decided not to interfere.
Within a week, Matilda had finished Great Expectations
which in that edition contained four hundred and eleven 
pages. "I loved it," she said to Mrs Phelps. "Has Mr Dickens
written any others?"
"A great number," said the astounded Mrs Phelps. "Shall I
choose you another?"
Over the next six months, under Mrs Phelps's
watchful and compassionate eye, Matilda read the following
books:

Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens
Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens
Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy
Gone to Earth by Mary Webb
Kim by Rudyard Kipling
The Invisible Man by H. G. Wells
The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway
The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner
The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck
The Good Companions by J. B. Priestley
Brighton Rock by Graham Greene
Animal Farm by George Orwell
 
It was a formidable list and by now Mrs Phelps was filled
with wonder and excitement, but it was probably a good thing
that she did not allow herself to be completely carried away
by it all. Almost anyone else witnessing the achievements of
this small child would have been tempted to make a great fuss
and shout the news all over the village and beyond, but not so
Mrs Phelps. She was someone who minded her own business
and had long since discovered it was seldom worth while to
interfere with other people's children.
"Mr Hemingway says a lot of things I don't understand,"
Matilda said to her. "Especially about men and women. But I
loved it all the same. The way he tells it I feel I am right there
on the spot watching it all happen."
''A fine writer will always make you feel that," Mrs Phelps
said. "And don't worry about the bits you can't understand.
Sit back and allow the words to wash around you, like music."
"I will, I will."
"Did you know", Mrs Phelps said, "that public libraries like
this allow you to borrow books and take them home?"
"I didn't know that," Matilda said. "Could I do it?"
"Of course," Mrs Phelps said. "When you have chosen the
book you want, bring it to me so I can make a note of it and 
it's yours for two weeks. You can take more than one if you
wish."

From then on, Matilda would visit the library only once a
week in order to take out new books and return the old ones.
Her own small bedroom now became her reading-room and
there she would sit and read most afternoons, often with a
mug of hot chocolate beside her. She was not quite tall
enough to reach things around the kitchen, but she kept a
small box in the outhouse which she brought in and stood on
in order to get whatever she wanted. Mostly it was hot
chocolate she made, warming the milk in a saucepan on the
stove before mixing it. Occasionally she made Bovril or
Ovaltine. It was pleasant to take a hot drink up to her room
and have it beside her as she sat in her silent room reading in
the empty house in the afternoons. The books transported her
into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who
lived exciting lives. She went on olden-day sailing ships with
Joseph Conrad. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway
and to India with Rudyard Kipling. She travelled all over the
world while sitting in her little room in an English village.

ij_chapter1 = '''I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair.
This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat,
insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received.
I am in here.
Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight sportcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine conference
table shiny with the spidered light of an Arizona noon. These are three Deans — of Admissions, Academic Affairs, Athletic
Affairs. I do not know which face belongs to whom.
I believe I appear neutral, maybe even pleasant, though I've been coached to err on the side of neutrality and not attempt what
would feel to me like a pleasant expression or smile.
I have committed to crossing my legs I hope carefully, ankle on knee, hands together in the lap of my slacks. My fingers are
mated into a mirrored series of what manifests, to me, as the letter X. The interview room's other personnel include: the
University's Director of Composition, its varsity tennis coach, and Academy prorector Mr. A. deLint. C.T. is beside me; the others
sit, stand and stand, respectively, at the periphery of my focus. The tennis coach jingles pocket-change. There is something
vaguely digestive about the room's odor. The high-traction sole of my complimentary Nike sneaker runs parallel to the wobbling
loafer of my mother's half-brother, here in his capacity as Headmaster, sitting in the chair to what I hope is my immediate right,
also facing Deans.
The Dean at left, a lean yellowish man whose fixed smile nevertheless has the impermanent quality of something stamped
into uncooperative material, is a personality-type I've come lately to appreciate, the type who delays need of any response from
me by relating my side of the story for me, to me. Passed a packet of computer-sheets by the shaggy lion of a Dean at center, he is
speaking more or less to these pages, smiling down.
'You are Harold Incandenza, eighteen, date of secondary-school graduation approximately one month from now, attending the
Enfield Tennis Academy, Enfield, Massachusetts, a boarding school, where you reside.' His reading glasses are rectangular, courtshaped, the sidelines at top and bottom. 'You are, according to Coach White and Dean [unintelligible], a regionally, nationally,
and continentally ranked junior tennis player, a potential O.N.A.N.C.A.A. athlete of substantial promise, recruited by Coach
White via correspondence with Dr. Tavis here commencing .. . February of this year.' The top page is removed and brought
around neatly to the bottom of the sheaf, at intervals. 'You have been in residence at the Enfield Tennis Academy since age
seven.’
I am debating whether to risk scratching the right side of my jaw, where there is a wen.
'Coach White informs our offices that he holds the Enfield Tennis Academy's program and achievements in high regard, that
the University of Arizona tennis squad has profited from the prior matriculation of several former E.T.A. alumni, one of whom
was one Mr. Aubrey F. deLint, who appears also to be with you here today. Coach White and his staff have given us —’
The yellow administrator's usage is on the whole undistinguished, though I have to admit he's made himself understood. The
Director of Composition seems to have more than the normal number of eyebrows. The Dean at right is looking at my face a bit
strangely.
Uncle Charles is saying that though he can anticipate that the Deans might be predisposed to weigh what he avers as coming
from his possible appearance as a kind of cheerleader for E.T.A., he can assure the assembled Deans that all this is true, and that
the Academy has presently in residence no fewer than a third of the continent's top thirty juniors, in age brackets all across the
board, and that I here, who go by 'Hal,' usually, am 'right up there among the very cream.' Right and center Deans smile
professionally; the heads of deLint and the coach incline as the Dean at left clears his throat:
'— belief that you could well make, even as a freshman, a real contribution to this University's varsity tennis program. We are
pleased,' he either says or reads, removing a page, 'that a competition of some major sort here has brought you down and given us
the chance to sit down and chat together about your application and potential recruitment and matriculation and scholarship.’
'I've been asked to add that Hal here is seeded third, Boys' 18-and-Under Singles, in the prestigious WhataBurger Southwest
Junior Invitational out at the Randolph Tennis Center —' says what I infer is Athletic Affairs, his cocked head showing a freckled
scalp.
'Out at Randolph Park, near the outstanding El Con Marriott,' C.T. inserts, 'a venue the whole contingent's been vocal about
finding absolutely top-hole thus far, which —’
'Just so, Chuck, and that according to Chuck here Hal has already justified his seed, he's reached the semifinals as of this
morning's apparently impressive win, and that he'll be playing out at the Center again tomorrow, against the winner of a
quarterfinal game tonight, and so will be playing tomorrow at I believe scheduled for 0830 —’
'Try to get under way before the godawful heat out there. Though of course a dry heat.’
'— and has apparently already qualified for this winter's Continental Indoors, up in Edmonton, Kirk tells me —' cocking
further to look up and left at the varsity coach, whose smile's teeth are radiant against a violent sunburn — 'Which is something
indeed.' He smiles, looking at me. 'Did we get all that right Hal.’
C.T. has crossed his arms casually; their triceps' flesh is webbed with mottle in the air-conditioned sunlight. 'You sure did.
Bill.' He smiles. The two halves of his mustache never quite match. 'And let me say if I may that Hal's excited, excited to be
invited for the third year running to the Invitational again, to be back here in a community he has real affection for, to visit with
your alumni and coaching staff, to have already justified his high seed in this week's not unstiff competition, to as they say still be
in it without the fat woman in the Viking hat having sung, so to speak, but of course most of all to have a chance to meet you
gentlemen and have a look at the facilities here. Everything here is absolutely top-slot, from what he's seen.’
There is a silence. DeLint shifts his back against the room's panelling and recenters his weight. My uncle beams and 
straightens a straight watchband. 62.5% of the room's faces are directed my way, pleasantly expectant. My chest bumps like a
dryer with shoes in it. I compose what I project will be seen as a smile. I turn this way and that, slightly, sort of directing the
expression to everyone in the room.
There is a new silence. The yellow Dean's eyebrows go circumflex. The two other Deans look to the Director of Composition.
The tennis coach has moved to stand at the broad window, feeling at the back of his crewcut. Uncle Charles strokes the forearm
above his watch. Sharp curved palm-shadows move slightly over the pine table's shine, the one head's shadow a black moon.
'Is Hal all right, Chuck?' Athletic Affairs asks. 'Hal just seemed to ... well, grimace. Is he in pain? Are you in pain, son?’
'Hal's right as rain,' smiles my uncle, soothing the air with a casual hand. 'Just a bit of a let's call it maybe a facial tic, slightly,
at all the adrenaline of being here on your impressive campus, justifying his seed so far without dropping a set, receiving that
official written offer of not only waivers but a living allowance from Coach White here, on Pac 10 letterhead, being ready in all
probability to sign a National Letter of Intent right here and now this very day, he's indicated to me.' C.T. looks to me, his look
horribly mild. I do the safe thing, relaxing every muscle in my face, emptying out all expression. I stare carefully into the
Kekuléan knot of the middle Dean's necktie.
My silent response to the expectant silence begins to affect the air of the room, the bits of dust and sportcoat-lint stirred
around by the AC's vents dancing jaggedly in the slanted plane of windowlight, the air over the table like the sparkling space just
above a fresh-poured seltzer. The coach, in a slight accent neither British nor Australian, is telling C.T. that the whole applicationinterface process, while usually just a pleasant formality, is probably best accentuated by letting the applicant speak up for
himself. Right and center Deans have inclined together in soft conference, forming a kind of tepee of skin and hair. I presume it's
probably facilitate that the tennis coach mistook for accentuate, though accelerate, while clunkier than facilitate, is from a phonetic
perspective more sensible, as a mistake. The Dean with the flat yellow face has leaned forward, his lips drawn back from his teeth
in what I see as concern. His hands come together on the conference table's surface. His own fingers look like they mate as my
own four-X series dissolves and I hold tight to the sides of my chair.
We need candidly to chat re potential problems with my application, they and I, he is beginning to say. He makes a reference
to candor and its value.
'The issues my office faces with the application materials on file from you, Hal, involve some test scores.' He glances down at
a colorful sheet of standardized scores in the trench his arms have made. 'The Admissions staff is looking at standardized test
scores from you that are, as I'm sure you know and can explain, are, shall we say ... subnormal.' I'm to explain.
It's clear that this really pretty sincere yellow Dean at left is Admissions. And surely the little aviarian figure at right is
Athletics, then, because the facial creases of the shaggy middle Dean are now pursed in a kind of distanced affront, an I'm-eatingsomething-that-makes-me-really-appreciate-the-presence-of-whatever-I'm-drinking-along-with-it look that spells professionally
Academic reservations. An uncomplicated loyalty to standards, then, at center. My uncle looks to Athletics as if puzzled. He shifts
slightly in his chair.
The incongruity between Admissions's hand- and face-color is almost wild. '—verbal scores that are just quite a bit closer to
zero than we're comfortable with, as against a secondary-school transcript from the institution where both your mother and her
brother are administrators —' reading directly out of the sheaf inside his arms' ellipse — 'that this past year, yes, has fallen off a
bit, but by the word I mean "fallen off" to outstanding from three previous years of frankly incredible.’
'Off the charts.’
'Most institutions do not even have grades of A with multiple pluses after it,' says the Director of Composition, his expression
impossible to interpret.
'This kind of ... how shall I put it... incongruity,' Admissions says, his expression frank and concerned, 'I've got to tell you
sends up a red flag of potential concern during the admissions process.’
'We thus invite you to explain the appearance of incongruity if not outright shenanigans.' Students has a tiny piping voice
that's absurd coming out of a face this big.
'Surely by incredible you meant very very very impressive, as opposed to literally quote "incredible," surely,' says C.T.,
seeming to watch the coach at the window massaging the back of his neck. The huge window gives out on nothing more than
dazzling sunlight and cracked earth with heat-shimmers over it.
'Then there is before us the matter of not the required two but nine separate application essays, some of which of nearly
monograph-length, each without exception being —' different sheet — 'the adjective various evalua-tors used was quote "stellar"
—’
Dir. of Comp.: 'I made in my assessment deliberate use of lapidary and effete.’
'— but in areas and with titles, I'm sure you recall quite well, Hal: "Neoclassical Assumptions in Contemporary Prescriptive
Grammar," "The Implications of Post-Fourier Transformations for a Holographically Mimetic Cinema," "The Emergence of
Heroic Stasis in Broadcast Entertainment" —’
' "Montague Grammar and the Semantics of Physical Modality"?’
' "A Man Who Began to Suspect He Was Made of Glass"?’
' "Tertiary Symbolism in Justinian Erotica"?’
Now showing broad expanses of recessed gum. 'Suffice to say that there's some frank and candid concern about the recipient
of these unfortunate test scores, though perhaps explainable test scores, being these essays' sole individual author.’
'I'm not sure Hal's sure just what's being implied here,' my uncle says. The Dean at center is fingering his lapels as he
interprets distasteful computed data.
'What the University is saying here is that from a strictly academic point of view there are admission problems that Hal needs
to try to help us iron out. A matriculant's first role at the University is and must be as a student. We couldn't admit a student we
have reason to suspect can't cut the mustard, no matter how much of an asset he might be on the field.’
'Dean Sawyer means the court, of course, Chuck,' Athletic Affairs says, head severely cocked so he's including the White
person behind him in the address somehow. 'Not to mention O.N.A.N.C.A.A. regulations and investigators always snuffling
around for some sort of whiff of the smell of impropriety.’ 
The varsity tennis coach looks at his own watch.
'Assuming these board scores are accurate reflectors of true capacity in this case,' Academic Affairs says, his high voice
serious and sotto, still looking at the file before him as if it were a plate of something bad, Til tell you right now my opinion is it
wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be fair to the other applicants. Wouldn't be fair to the University community.' He looks at me. 'And
it'd be especially unfair to Hal himself. Admitting a boy we see as simply an athletic asset would amount to just using that boy.
We're under myriad scrutiny to make sure we're not using anybody. Your board results, son, indicate that we could be accused of
using you.’
Uncle Charles is asking Coach White to ask the Dean of Athletic Affairs whether the weather over scores would be as heavy
if I were, say, a revenue-raising football prodigy. The familiar panic at feeling misperceived is rising, and my chest bumps and
thuds. I expend energy on remaining utterly silent in my chair, empty, my eyes two great pale zeros. People have promised to get
me through this.
Uncle C.T., though, has the pinched look of the cornered. His voice takes on an odd timbre when he's cornered, as if he were
shouting as he receded. 'Hal's grades at E.T.A., which is I should stress an Academy, not simply a camp or factory, accredited by
both the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the North American Sports Academy Association, it's focused on the total needs of
the player and student, founded by a towering intellectual figure whom I hardly need name, here, and based by him on the
rigorous Oxbridge Quadrivium-Trivium curricular model, a school fully staffed and equipped, by a fully certified staff, should
show that my nephew here can cut just about any Pac 10 mustard that needs cutting, and that —’
DeLint is moving toward the tennis coach, who is shaking his head.
'— would be able to see a distinct flavor of minor-sport prejudice about this whole thing,' C.T. says, crossing and recrossing
his legs as I listen, composed and staring.
The room's carbonated silence is now hostile. T think it's time to let the actual applicant himself speak out on his own behalf,'
Academic Affairs says very quietly. 'This seems somehow impossible with you here, sir.’
Athletics smiles tiredly under a hand that massages the bridge of his nose. 'Maybe you'd excuse us for a moment and wait
outside, Chuck.’
'Coach White could accompany Mr. Tavis and his associate out to reception,' the yellow Dean says, smiling into my
unfocused eyes.
'— led to believe this had all been ironed out in advance, from the —' C.T. is saying as he and deLint are shown to the door.
The tennis coach extends a hypertrophied arm. Athletics says 'We're all friends and colleagues here.’
This is not working out. It strikes me that exit signs would look to a native speaker of Latin like red-lit signs that say HE
leaves. I would yield to the urge to bolt for the door ahead of them if I could know that bolting for the door is what the men in this
room would see. DeLint is murmuring something to the tennis coach. Sounds of keyboards, phone consoles as the door is briefly
opened, then firmly shut. I am alone among administrative heads.
'— offense intended to anyone,' Athletic Affairs is saying, his sportcoat tan and his necktie insigniated in tiny print — 'beyond
just physical abilities out there in play, which believe me we respect, want, believe me.’
'— question about it we wouldn't be so anxious to chat with you directly, see?’
'— that we've known in processing several prior applications through Coach White's office that the Enfield School is
operated, however impressively, by close relations of first your brother, who I can still remember the way White's predecessor
Maury Klamkin wooed that kid, so that grades' objectivity can be all too easily called into question —’
'By whomsoever's calling — N.A.A.U.P., ill-willed Pac 10 programs, O.N.A.N.C.A.A. —’
The essays are old ones, yes, but they are mine; de moi. But they are, yes, old, not quite on the application's instructed subject
of Most Meaningful Educational Experience Ever. If I'd done you one from the last year, it would look to you like some sort of
infant's random stabs on a keyboard, and to you, who use whomsoever as a subject. And in this new smaller company, the
Director of Composition seems abruptly to have actuated, emerged as both the Alpha of the pack here and way more effeminate
than he'd seemed at first, standing hip-shot with a hand on his waist, walking with a roll to his shoulders, jingling change as he
pulls up his pants as he slides into the chair still warm from C.T.'s bottom, crossing his legs in a way that inclines him well into
my personal space, so that I can see multiple eyebrow-tics and capillary webs in the oysters below his eyes and smell fabricsoftener and the remains of a breath-mint turned sour.
'. . . a bright, solid, but very shy boy, we know about your being very shy, Kirk White's told us what your athletically built if
rather stand-offish younger instructor told him,' the Director says softly, cupping what I feel to be a hand over my sportcoat's
biceps (surely not), 'who simply needs to swallow hard and trust and tell his side of the story to these gentlemen who bear no
maliciousness none at all but are doing our jobs and trying to look out for everyone's interests at the same time.’
I can picture deLint and White sitting with their elbows on their knees in the defecatory posture of all athletes at rest, deLint
staring at his huge thumbs, while C.T. in the reception area paces in a tight ellipse, speaking into his portable phone. I have been
coached for this like a Don before a RICO hearing. A neutral and affectless silence. The sort of all-defensive game Schtitt used to
have me play: the best defense: let everything bounce off you; do nothing. I'd tell you all you want and more, if the sounds I made
could be what you hear.
Athletics with his head out from under his wing: '— to avoid admission procedures that could be seen as primarily athleticsoriented. It could be a mess, son.’
'Bill means the appearance, not necessarily the real true facts of the matter, which you alone can fill in,' says the Director of
Composition.
'— the appearance of the high athletic ranking, the subnormal scores, the over-academic essays, the incredible grades
vortexing out of what could be seen as a nepotistic situation.’
The yellow Dean has leaned so far forward that his tie is going to have a horizontal dent from the table-edge, his face sallow
and kindly and no-shit-whatever:
'Look here, Mr. Incandenza, Hal, please just explain to me why we couldn't be accused of using you, son. Why nobody could 
come and say to us, why, look here, University of Arizona, here you are using a boy for just his body, a boy so shy and withdrawn
he won't speak up for himself, a jock with doctored marks and a store-bought application.’
The Brewster's-Angle light of the tabletop appears as a rose flush behind my closed lids. I cannot make myself understood. 'I
am not just a jock,' I say slowly. Distinctly. 'My transcript for the last year might have been dickied a bit, maybe, but that was to
get me over a rough spot. The grades prior to that are de moi.' My eyes are closed; the room is silent. 'I cannot make myself
understood, now.' I am speaking slowly and distinctly. 'Call it something I ate.’
It's funny what you don't recall. Our first home, in the suburb of Weston, which I barely remember — my eldest brother Orin
says he can remember being in the home's backyard with our mother in the early spring, helping the Moms till some sort of garden
out of the cold yard. March or early April. The garden's area was a rough rectangle laid out with Popsicle sticks and twine. Orin
was removing rocks and hard clods from the Moms's path as she worked the rented Rototiller, a wheelbarrow-shaped, gas-driven
thing that roared and snorted and bucked and he remembers seemed to propel the Moms rather than vice versa, the Moms very tall
and having to stoop painfully to hold on, her feet leaving drunken prints in the tilled earth. He remembers that in the middle of the
tilling I came tear-assing out the door and into the backyard wearing some sort of fuzzy red Pooh-wear, crying, holding out
something he said was really unpleasant-looking in my upturned palm. He says I was around five and crying and was vividly red
in the cold spring air. I was saying something over and over; he couldn't make it out until our mother saw me and shut down the
tiller, ears ringing, and came over to see what I was holding out. This turned out to have been a large patch of mold — Orin posits
from some dark corner of the Weston home's basement, which was warm from the furnace and flooded every spring. The patch
itself he describes as horrific: darkly green, glossy, vaguely hirsute, speckled with parasitic fungal points of yellow, orange, red.
Worse, they could see that the patch looked oddly incomplete, gnawed-on; and some of the nauseous stuff was smeared around
my open mouth. 'I ate this,' was what I was saying. I held the patch out to the Moms, who had her contacts out for the dirty work,
and at first, bending way down, saw only her crying child, hand out, proffering; and in that most maternal of reflexes she, who
feared and loathed more than anything spoilage and filth, reached to take whatever her baby held out — as in how many used
heavy Kleenex, spit-back candies, wads of chewed-out gum in how many theaters, airports, backseats, tournament lounges? O.
stood there, he says, hefting a cold clod, playing with the Velcro on his puffy coat, watching as the Moms, bent way down to me,
hand reaching, her lowering face with its presbyopic squint, suddenly stopped, froze, beginning to I.D. what it was I held out,
countenancing evidence of oral contact with same. He remembers her face as past describing. Her outstretched hand, still
Rototrembling, hung in the air before mine.
'I ate this,' I said.
'Pardon me?’
O. says he can only remember (sic) saying something caustic as he lim-boed a crick out of his back. He says he must have felt
a terrible impending anxiety. The Moms refused ever even to go into the damp basement. I had stopped crying, he remembers, and
simply stood there, the size and shape of a hydrant, in red PJ's with attached feet, holding out the mold, seriously, like the report of
some kind of audit.
O. says his memory diverges at this point, probably as a result of anxiety. In his first memory, the Moms's path around the
yard is a broad circle of hysteria:
'God!' she calls out.
'Help! My son ate this!' she yells in Orin's second and more fleshed-out recollection, yelling it over and over, holding the
speckled patch aloft in a pincer of fingers, running around and around the garden's rectangle while O. gaped at his first real sight
of adult hysteria. Suburban neighbors' heads appeared in windows and over the fences, looking. O. remembers me tripping over
the garden's laid-out twine, getting up dirty, crying, trying to follow.
'God! Help! My son ate this! Help!' she kept yelling, running a tight pattern just inside the square of string; and my brother
Orin remembers noting how even in hysterical trauma her flight-lines were plumb, her footprints Native-American-straight, her
turns, inside the ideogram of string, crisp and martial, crying 'My son ate this! Help!' and lapping me twice before the memory
recedes.
'My application's not bought,' I am telling them, calling into the darkness of the red cave that opens out before closed eyes. 'I
am not just a boy who plays tennis. I have an intricate history. Experiences and feelings. I'm complex.
'I read,' I say. 'I study and read. I bet I've read everything you've read. Don't think I haven't. I consume libraries. I wear out
spines and ROM-drives. I do things like get in a taxi and say, "The library, and step on it." My instincts concerning syntax and
mechanics are better than your own, I can tell, with due respect.
'But it transcends the mechanics. I'm not a machine. I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. I could,
if you'd let me, talk and talk. Let's talk about anything. I believe the influence of Kierkegaard on Camus is underestimated. I
believe Dennis Gabor may very well have been the Antichrist. I believe Hobbes is just Rousseau in a dark mirror. I believe, with
Hegel, that transcendence is absorption. I could interface you guys right under the table,' I say. 'I'm not just a creãtus,
manufactured, conditioned, bred for a function.’
I open my eyes. 'Please don't think I don't care.’
I look out. Directed my way is horror. I rise from the chair. I see jowls sagging, eyebrows high on trembling foreheads,
cheeks bright-white. The chair recedes below me.
'Sweet mother of Christ,' the Director says.
T'm fine,' I tell them, standing. From the yellow Dean's expression, there's a brutal wind blowing from my direction.
Academics' face has gone instantly old. Eight eyes have become blank discs that stare at whatever they see.
'Good God,' whispers Athletics.
'Please don't worry,' I say. 'I can explain.' I soothe the air with a casual hand.
Both my arms are pinioned from behind by the Director of Comp., who wrestles me roughly down, on me with all his weight.
I taste floor.
'What's wrong?’
I say 'Nothing is wrong.’
