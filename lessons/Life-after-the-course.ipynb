    "### Python and a package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS and Linux come with Python preinstalled by default, though this is usually an outdated version of Python. In principle, you *could* also just [download Python from the website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). However, since it is likely that you'll be installing more software alongside Python, we recommend investing some additional time to install a package manager instead, which will give you a central workflow for installing Python as well as any related software. Especially on Windows, using a package manager will likely provide a smoother experience as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to installing a package manager is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). It is specifically targeted at data scientists working with Python and it ships with many commonly used Python packages by default, as well as the Spyder IDE that we mentioned in the editor section. For a much smaller download, you can install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) instead, to get just Python, Anaconda's package manager (`conda`) and a small amount of supporting software. While conventient, `conda` is not a complete solution like the general purpose package managers that we discuss next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux distribution generally ship with a general purpose package manager by default, such as `apt-get` or `yum`. If you work with Linux, you are probably already familiar with your package manager. If you install Python through such a package manager, you might need to install a secondary package for Python *development* as well, which might for example be named `python-devel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS does not ship with a package manager by default, but you can install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh).\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows does not follow the same conventions as Linux and macOS, but there are options. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) is a dedicated package manager for Windows. Since Windows 10, Microsoft provides its own [native package manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) as well. At the DH Lab, we have tried neither of these options, so we cannot comment on how well they work. Alternatively, you can use the `pacman` package manager that is included with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org), which we recommend to install anyway. More about Git in a later section."

This section is about the latter kind. When you use such a Python package in your project, this is called a dependency.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    # Let's see whether Python is consistent today.\n",
    "    if 1 < 2:\n",
    "        return 0 # success\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return 1 # failure\n",

    "## Program arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously shown the program `greet.py`, which will ask us for a name and then cheer it. Arguably, it would be a bit more efficient if we could pass the name already when calling the program, so we could skip the interactive question. Something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python3 greet.py Julian\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example command, `Julian` is an argument to the `greet.py` program, similar to how we can pass arguments to functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using program arguments is a great way to make your program more flexible. For example, by making the path to a file a program argument, you make it easier to run your program with other files, or on another computer, where files might be located in a different folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we saw `sys.exit`, which lets us set the program exit code; the same `sys` standard module also provides `argv`, which is a list with the program arguments, including the name of your program as the first element. Since `main` represents the program as a whole, let's extend the pattern for invoking `main` to include both program arguments and the exit status:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "def main(argv):\n",
    "    if len(argv) == 1:\n",
    "        print(\"You didn't pass any arguments.\")\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    print('You passed these arguments:')\n",
    "    print(argv[1:])\n",
    "    return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general case, a program may have many parameters, some of which may be optional. There is a syntax for working with named arguments as well, which would look like `python3 greet.py --name Julian` in our example above. By convention, the most important named arguments can also be abbreviated, which would look like `-n` instead of `--name`. You may also have parameters that accept a variable number of values, and then we generally expect that we can pass named arguments in any order. As you might imagine, extracting all that information correctly from `sys.argv`, which is just a simple list of strings, would be really difficult. Thankfully, you don't have to do this yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `argparse` standard module gives you the means to just describe which arguments your program expects. It will read `sys.argv` for you and figure out what goes with what. The Python documentation includes an excellent [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html) on how to use it, so we won't do that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that you have read that tutorial, here is a pattern that we suggest for integrating `argparse` in the invocation of your `main` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "# The argument parser is defined outside of the main function.\n",
    "# In a large program with many options, you might even have\n",
    "# a dedicated module just for the argument parser.\n",
    "argparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(\n",
    "    description='Description of your program',\n",
    "    # maybe you also want to define an epilog\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "def main(argv):\n",
    "    options = argparser.parse_args(argv[1:])\n",
    "    # the options object can be passed to other functions that\n",
    "    # main calls internally\n",
    "    return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final tip, we will mention that you can save a set of arguments to a file and then pass the name of that file to your program in order to have all arguments in the file applied. This is functionality that `argparse` gives us for free. Suppose that I often want to run `python3 greet.py --name Julian`. I can write the following in a file named `greet.conf`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    --name\n",
    "    Julian\n",
    "\n",
    "If I then run `python3 greet.py @greet.conf`, it will do exactly the same as when I would run `python3 greet.py --name Julian`. In this case, the difference is not so impressive, but when you are passing more than a few arguments, this can be very convenient."

    "## Version control (Git)\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system (VCS) keeps track of the changes that you make to your code. This enables you to find back changes that you made in the past and find out why you made them. You can also use this to revert an old change, while keeping changes that came after it. VCSs do this by efficiently storing all versions of your code in a system called a *repository*.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modern VCSs also allow you to create *branches*, which you can think of as parallel series of versions, or \"alternative histories\" of your code. You might work on a new feature on one branch, recording several changes as you go, then switch to another branch to fix a bug that you noticed while working on the feature, but which isn't related to the feature itself. Fixing the bug on a separate branch lets you focus on the bug, without having to worry about unfinished code related to the new feature. When you finish the bugfix, you switch back to the feature branch, and when you finish that as well, you can *merge* the branches, creating a single version of your program that includes *both* the bugfix *and* the new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are also a great tool for collaborating with other programmers. When working on a large project, you might develop one feature while another programmer is developing another feature at the same time on another branch. You don't have to see each other's changes until you merge your branches together. This is such an efficient workflow that all software development teams are using it. However, once you get used to a VCS, you'll want to use it even for a small project that you work on alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed VCS (DVCS) that has become very popular. \"Distributed\" basically means that it can handle branches very well: developers store their branches locally and they can optionally synchronize them with collaborators. Popular platforms like GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab facilitate such collaboration (although it can also be done without such a platform). Git is by no means the only good DVCS (for example, Mercurial is also good), but if you have not chosen a DVCS yet, Git is a fine choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book) is a detailed introduction to Git. You can either read it on screen, free of charge, or buy it in print. If you want to get started quickly with a short tutorial and save the book for later, [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com) is a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save many commits (versions) with small changes between them. Don't overhaul entire modules and then record only a single new commit, because this largely defeats the purpose of having a VCS.\n",
    "- One logical change per commit. If you fix a typo, then that fix is a commit all by itself, even if you changed only a single character. If you rename a function which you happen to call in twenty different modules, then the name changes in the module where it is defined as well as in all the modules where it is called all belong together in a single commit. Other, unrelated changes that you might have made in those same modules should *not* be part of the same commit.\n",
    "- If you worked a little bit \"out of order\", Git has tricks that let you include only some of the changes that you made in the next commit, while keeping the remainder for subsequent commits. Look into \"interactive staging\" on how to do this.\n",
    "- Similarly, if you make a change that with hindsight should have been included in an earlier commit, you can fix this afterwards. Look into \"interactive rebase\" on how to do this. Note that you should only rebase commits that you have not shared with other people yet.\n",
    "- If, with hindsight, you combined changes in a commit that should have been in separate commits, you can also split that commit afterwards during an interactive rebase. However, keep in mind that reordering and merging small commits is much easier than breaking apart large commits. This is another reason why you should err on the side of tiny commits."
