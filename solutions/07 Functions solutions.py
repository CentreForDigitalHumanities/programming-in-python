# ### This module
#
# - Storing code in a variable so you can reuse it.
# - Being explicit about the purpose of your code.

# ## Exercise 7.1: functions

# %% [markdown] id="hfcz-cSEKZWW"
# 1. We have seen several standard functions during the course, such as `ord` and `len`. List as many as you can from memory. Try to list the types of the parameters and return values of each function as well. Do any of these functions have side effects?

# %% [markdown] id="ZG0lv6MhVP8L"
# Some examples:
# - `ord`: Has 1 parameter: a string of 1 character. The return value is an integer. No side effects.
# - `len`: Has 1 parameter: a list, tuple or other iterable. The return value is an integer. No side effects.
# - `input`: Has 1 optional parameter `prompt`, which should be a string. The function has a side effect, which is to wait for the user to type something. Its return value is a string (namely the text that you have entered).

# %% [markdown] id="BUnMsiUzKbws"
# 2. For exercise purposes, code in the following blocks may call `print` inside a function and omit a docstring. Predict the output, then run the code to see whether your prediction was right. Try to explain any discrepancies.
