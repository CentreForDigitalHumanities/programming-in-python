# ## Exercise 10.1: Dictionaries

# %% [markdown]
# 1. In each of the code blocks below, try to predict what will be printed, then run the code. If your guess was incorrect, try to figure out why the result is different. If your guess was correct, celebrate!

# %%
{0: 0}

# %% [markdown]
# A dictionary with `0` as the only key and `0` its value. The dictionary as a whole is the last value in the cell, so the notebook echoes it to us.

# %%
{'0': 0}

# %% [markdown]
# Like the previous, but with the string `'0'` as key.

# %%
{1 + 2: 3 * 4}

# %% [markdown]
# Keys and values in a literal dictionary can be expressions. They are evaluated before being stored in the dictionary.

# %%
{'1' + '2': {3: 'Hooray!'}}

# %% [markdown]
# Dictionaries can be used as values in other dictionaries (but not as keys).

# %%
programming_languages = {
    'Fortran': 1957,
    'Algol 60': 1960,
    'C': 1972,
    'Perl': 1987,
    'Python': 1991,
    'Julia': 2012,
    'Mojo': 2023,
}

# %% [markdown]
# Assignments cause the variable to obtain a value as a side effect. The assignment itself has no result value, so we see no output. But the notebook will remember the `programming_languages` dictionary for us, so we can use it in the following code blocks.

# %%
programming_languages[Perl]

# %% [markdown]
# If you write a word without quotes, Python attempts to find a variable with that name. We did not define one, so we get a `NameError`.

# %%
programming_languages[1960]

# %% [markdown]
# `1960` is a value that appears in the dictionary, but the `[]` notation only looks for keys.

# %%
programming_languages['Perl']

# %% [markdown]
# Third try is a blessing! `'Perl'` is, indeed, a key that appears in the dictionary, and its associated value is `1987`.

# %%
{None: None}[None]

# %% [markdown]
# The notation is valid; `None` can be both a key and a value in a dictionary. The lookup is successful and returns `None`. Notebooks only echo the last value when it is **not** `None`, so we see no output.
#
# You can verify that there is a value by wrapping the entire expression in `print()`.

# %%
programming_languages.get('Per1', 2125)

# %% [markdown]
# Note that we wrote `'Per1'`, not `'Perl'`. See the difference? Because `'Per1'` is not in the dictionary, the default (fallback) value of `2125` is used.

# %%
programming_languages.get('Per1')

# %% [markdown]
# `'Per1'` is still not in the dictionary. Since we don't supply a default in this case, we get `None`, which produces no output.

# %%
programming_languages.get('Python', None)

# %% [markdown]
# `'Python'` is in the dictionary, so we get its associated value. The default of `None` is never used.

# %%
programming_languages.get('Python')

# %% [markdown]
# The result is the same as in the previous code block, because the default value is irrelevant.

# %%
'Per1' in programming_languages

# %% [markdown]
# There's that `'Per1'` again, which is not in the dictionary.

# %%
'Fortran' in programming_languages

# %% [markdown]
# `'Fortran'`, on the other hand, is in the dictionary, hence `True`.

# %%
2012 in programming_languages

# %% [markdown]
# `2012` is in the dictionary as a value but not as a key. `in` only looks for keys.

# %%
programming_languages.update({'Per1': 2125, 'Raku': 2015})

# %% [markdown]
# `update` changes `programming_languages` as a side effect. There is no return value, so we see no output.

# %%
2012 in programming_languages.values()

# %% [markdown]
# Since we query the `.values()` of `programming_languages`, `2012` is now found.

# %%
('Per1', 'Perl') in programming_languages.items()

# %% [markdown]
# When we look `in` a dictionary's `.items()`, we query `(key, value)` pairs. `('Per1', 2125)` would return `True` and so would `('Perl', 1987)`, but not `('Per1', 1987)` or `('Perl', 2125)`.

# %%
del programming_languages[2012]

for language, year in programming_languages.items():
    print(f'{language} first appeared in {year}')

# %% [markdown]
# The first line attempts to remove the `2012` key from the dictionary, but there is none. Hence a `KeyError`. If you comment out the first line, you will find that the loop prints a nice line for each programming language.

# %% [markdown]
# 2. The code below attempts to count the frequencies of the individual characters in our party invitation from module 6. There is a bug which prevents it from working. Fix the bug.

# %%
invitation = '''
    Dear Sheean,

    I hereby invite you for my Python party on the 11th of April.
    The bar will open at 2 PM. üç∏ Please bring pseudocode.

    Yours sincerely,

    count = frequencies.get(character, 0)
    # Here is the bug: dictionaries have a .get method, but no .set.
    #frequencies.set(character, count + 1)
    # The fix is to use assignment with a square bracket lookup.
    frequencies[character] = count + 1
print(frequencies)

# 3 . Below are two dictionaries containing information about different types of fruit. Print a nice message about each fruit stating its colour and price. For example, _An apple is red and costs ‚Ç¨ 2.50_, etc.

# %%
fruit_colors = {'apple': 'red', 'banana': 'yellow', 'orange': 'orange'}

# The example sentence includes 'a'/'an' ('an apple' / 'a banana')
# which was a bit of an oversight: the point of this exercise
# was to loop through a dictionary and access values.
# You could make a solution like this to avoid it.

# 4 . Here is a longer lists of fruit colours. Write a function `count_fruits` which gets gets a colour as input and returns the number of fruits that have that colour (according to `lots_of_fruit`).

# %%

# 5 . The list `fruit_basket` contains a bunch of fruits. Can you make a dictionary `fruit_counts` which gives the amount for each fruit in `fruit_basket`? (Do not count the fruits by hand!)
